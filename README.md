# OpenShift Mock Cartridge

This is a mock implementation of the [OpenShift Cartridge API](https://github.com/openshift/origin-server/blob/master/documentation/oo_cartridge_developers_guide.adoc) which is used to test the OpenShift node platform functionality. The mock cartridges maintains a store of what actions have been performed and provides methods to test for those actions.  

This cartridge was intentionally omitted from the [OpenShift Cartridge Guide](https://github.com/openshift/origin-server/blob/master/documentation/oo_cartridge_guide.adoc).
